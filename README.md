# Creative-Scrapyard
üìñ Overview:
Creative Scrapyard is an innovative e-commerce website that connects people who want to sell their old or scrap items with artists and creators who can reuse those items to make something useful, decorative, and unique. The platform creates a cycle where scrap is not wasted, but instead transformed into creative products that can also be sold on the same website.
